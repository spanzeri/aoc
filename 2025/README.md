# AOC 2025

This time I plan to do AOC in [odin-lang](https://odin-lang.org/).

I put together the smallest template possible.

## Usage

To build or run the project, you can use:

```bash
odin run . -- -day=<day_number>
```

The first time, the program is going to generate source and input files for all
days.

If you want to change the default template for a day, update the content at the
top of `main.odin`.

If you want to recreate certain days (for example if you changed the template),
just delete the `dayxx.odin` and `input_dayxx.txt` files and run the program again.

After the first run, all the source files are automatically included and
registered to run.

> [!NOTE]
> If you find this template after AOC 2025 has started, feel free to delete all
> the source files except `main.odin` and you are good to go.
